# Also, some firewalls and NAT gateways will kill idle connections after
# similar lengths of time.

# This specifies a program or script script which is run just before each

# same user bbackupd is running as, usually root.
#
# The script must output (print) either "now" or a number to STDOUT (and a 
# terminating newline, no quotes).
#
# If the result was "now", then the sync will happen. If it's a number, then 
# no backup will happen for that number of seconds (bbackupd will pause) and 
# then the script will be run again.
#
# Use this to temporarily stop bbackupd from syncronising or connecting to the 
# store. For example, you could use this on a laptop to only backup when on a 
# specific network, or when it has a working Internet connection.

# BackupLocations specifies which locations on disc should be backed up. Each
# directory is in the format
# 
# 	name
# 	{
# 		Path = /path/of/directory
# 		(optional exclude directives)
# 	}
# 
# 'name' is derived from the Path by the config script, but should merely be
# unique.
# 
# The exclude directives are of the form
# 
# 	[Exclude|AlwaysInclude][File|Dir][|sRegex] = regex or full pathname
# 
# (The regex suffix is shown as 'sRegex' to make File or Dir plural)
#
# For example:
# 
# 	ExcludeDir = /home/guest-user
# 	ExcludeFilesRegex = *.(mp3|MP3)$
# 	AlwaysIncludeFile = /home/username/veryimportant.mp3
# 
# This excludes the directory /home/guest-user from the backup along with all mp3
# files, except one MP3 file in particular.
# 
# In general, Exclude excludes a file or directory, unless the directory is
# explicitly mentioned in a AlwaysInclude directive. However, Box Backup
# does NOT scan inside excluded directories and will never back up an
# AlwaysIncluded file or directory inside an excluded directory or any
# subdirectory thereof.
#
# To back up a directory inside an excluded directory, use a configuration
# like this, to ensure that each directory in the path to the important
# files is included, but none of their contents will be backed up except
# the directories futher down that path to the important one.
#
# ExcludeDirsRegex = /home/user/bigfiles/.*
# ExcludeFilesRegex = /home/user/bigfiles/.*
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path/to
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path/important
# AlwaysIncludeDir = /home/user/bigfiles/path/important/files
# AlwaysIncludeDirsRegex = /home/user/bigfiles/path/important/files/.*
# AlwaysIncludeFilesRegex = /home/user/bigfiles/path/important/files/.*
# 
# If a directive ends in Regex, then it is a regular expression rather than a 
# explicit full pathname. See
# 
# 	man 7 re_format
# 
# for the regex syntax on your platform.
