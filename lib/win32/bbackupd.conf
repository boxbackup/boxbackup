# BackupLocations specifies which locations on disc should be backed up. Each
# directory is in the format
# 
# 	name
# 	{
# 		Path = /path/of/directory
# 		(optional exclude directives)
# 	}
# 
# 'name' is derived from the Path by the config script, but should merely be
# unique.
# 
# The exclude directives are of the form
# 
# 	[Exclude|AlwaysInclude][File|Dir][|sRegex] = regex or full pathname
# 
# (The regex suffix is shown as 'sRegex' to make File or Dir plural)
#
# For example:
# 
# 	ExcludeDir = /home/guest-user
# 	ExcludeFilesRegex = *.(mp3|MP3)$
# 	AlwaysIncludeFile = /home/username/veryimportant.mp3
# 
# This excludes the directory /home/guest-user from the backup along with all mp3
# files, except one MP3 file in particular.
# 
# In general, Exclude excludes a file or directory, unless the directory is
# explicitly mentioned in a AlwaysInclude directive.
# 
# If a directive ends in Regex, then it is a regular expression rather than a
# explicit full pathname. See
# 
# 	man 7 re_format
# 
# for the regex syntax on your platform.
