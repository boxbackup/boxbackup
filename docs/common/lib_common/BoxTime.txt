TITLE BoxTime

Not strictly a class, but time is presented in the project as 64 bit integers as microseconds since the UNIX Epoch.

There are a number of utility functions in the BoxTime*.h files, which are useful.

To get BoxTime values from a struct stat, use the FileModificationTime.h functions.
